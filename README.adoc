= FutabaVFD Library for Arduino =

This library allows an Arduino board to control VFD displays based on the Futaba 202SD01A/C (or a compatible) chipset. These displays can be found in most old HP DesignJet plotters.  
The pinout for the Futaba US202SD01A/C displays is as follows:  

```
1 - +5V ( can be powered from arduino board)
2 - CLOCK
3 - GND  
4 - DATA  
5 - STROBE  
```
